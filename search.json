    "text": "After the best season in the Fred Hoiberg era, Nebraska basketball entered the year with expectations of returning to the Big Dance. With a newly assembled roster through the transfer portal and key players returning, it seemed like there was no way this team wouldn’t at least make a push for an at-large bid. After a first half that set them up for success the rest of the season, we saw a completely different team down the stretch—one that not only destroyed the Huskers’ tournament dreams but also failed to qualify for the Big Ten tournament. So, what happened between the first and second half of the season?\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\n\n\nCode\niron(\nwaffle(\n  nuwaffle1,\n  rows = 3,\n  colors = c(\"#000000\", \"#E41C38\",\"white\")\n)+\n  labs(\n    title = \"Nebraska's inconsistency leads to roller coaster season\",\n    subtitle = \"The Huskers looked like two diffrent teams all through out the season\",\n) +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n     plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n),\nwaffle(\n  nuwaffle2,\n  rows = 3,\n  colors = c(\"#000000\", \"#E41C38\")\n)+\n  labs(\n      x = \"1 square = 1 result\",\n  caption=\"By: Brady Rasso| Source: hoopR\"\n )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Huskers were one of the streakiest teams in the country, with the ability to get hot and torch opponents from three, going on long win streaks—or go ice cold and struggle to take care of lesser competition, leading to multiple consecutive losses.
